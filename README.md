# Chinese Restaurant Process Simulation
#### Jack Potrykus & Ruben Abbou

## Motivation

The Chinese Restaurant Process (CRP) is a Bayesian nonparametric method which can be used to cluster microarray gene expression data. Many of the successful techniques which have proven to work for this type of data (such as EXAMPLES) rely on previous knowledge about the data such as the number of clusters. This can be problematic as microarray data may contain important fluctuation and we may not always know the number of clusters we aim to separate. The CRP provides an alternative method which does not require prior knowledge on the data.
